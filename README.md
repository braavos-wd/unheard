# Echoes & Circles | The Urban Sanctuary

A digital resonance network for the modern young adult. This space bypasses the noise of traditional social media to focus on deep human connection, anonymous vulnerability, and collective intent.

## Core Features
1.  **Echoes**: Encrypted, permanent reflections of the human experience. Distilled through AI to preserve the raw integrity of your thoughts.
2.  **Circles**: Anonymous, vocal sharing spaces for real-time resonance.
    *   **Resonance Field**: Discover circles globally via a manual "Leap" search or sync to your physical location.
    *   **Mood Blooms**: A dynamic tagging system that evolves based on collective usage. Discover "Stable Blooms" (common moods) and "Emergent Frequencies" (trending topics identified by AI).
3.  **Whispers**: End-to-end encrypted messaging for bonded souls. Share scheduled session invites directly into chats.
4.  **The Crucible**: A democratic funding engine where "Aura Score" validates community-led sanctuary initiatives.

## Technical Philosophy
-   **AI (Gemini 3/2.5)**: Used for tone-sensitive transcription, ritualistic guidance, and semantic "Leap" discovery.
-   **Sovereign Data**: Local-first storage with simulated E2E encryption for maximum privacy.
-   **Brutalist UX**: Sharp, high-contrast, and performant design tailored for urban aesthetics.

## Integrity Measures
-   **Aura Score**: Measures the weight of your contribution to the sanctuary.
